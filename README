           Triplane Classic - a side-scrolling dogfighting game

Intro
=====

Triplane Classic is a side-scrolling dogfighting game featuring solo
missions and multiplayer mode with up to four players. It is a port of
the original Triplane Turmoil game for DOS and aims to match the
original game exactly so that high scores remain comparable to the
original.

Please read the manual page for information on how to actually play
the game. Also see README.install if you want to build the game from
source code.

Changes in this version located in https://github.com/d1maxa/triplane:

-800x600 resolution support in single player mode
-Joystick support in single player mode
-4 joysticks support in multiplayer
-5-12 planes support in multiplayer
-1200x400 and 2400x200 resolutions support (start game with '-1split' or '-nosplit' command line option)
-fixed ai for Finland and England on Cavern map in multiplayer

My version is based on vranki version. Changes of his version located in https://github.com/vranki/triplane:

 - Bullets fly a bit further
 - Bullets get some randomness in their velocity causing a small 
shotgun effect
 - Bullets have a bit more gravity
 - Bombs have a short fuse time when they are released and they cannot
hit aeroplanes during it
 - Damaged planes lose some engine power
 - Game starts with sane default amounts of bombs, ammo & fuel
 - Damage from bullets is constant, not random
 - Debian packaging copied from Ubuntu source package
 - New option -nosplash to disable splash screen
 - Spinning when going too high is now shorter - there is a
   good chance of survival
 - If throttle is reversed, plane does not take off automatically
   when button is not held. Player needs to press throttle button
   to take off.


These changes have been extensively play-tested in four player
combat in Symbio Tampere office. We really enjoy the game.

Todo:

Make these configurable to stay compatible with original gameplay
OR
Rename the project to clearly show this is different from original.

You can see source changes by comparing initial git import to
latest revision.
